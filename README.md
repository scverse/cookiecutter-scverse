# Scverse Cookiecutter Template

The purpose of this template is to get you started quickly building a best-practice python library for a [scverse][] ecosystem package.
Ecosystem packages are independent software libraries that interact with scverse core packages and depend on [anndata][] and [mudata][] data structures.

## Features

-   continuous integration using GitHub actions.
-   [pre-commit][] checks
-   tutorials built with [nbsphinx][]
-   documentation hosted by [readthedocs][]
-   [flit][] as build system
-   [bump2version][]

## Usage

To use this template, you will need a few dependencies:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter pre-commit
```

Now create the project and follow the prompts:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/scverse/cookiecutter-scverse
```

This will create a git repository with a filed out template in it.
Now `cd` into the newly created directory and make the initial commit!

Further instructions on using this template can be found in the contributing guide included in the project. Build the docs by installing a development version of the package and running sphinx:

```
pip install -e ".[dev,doc,test]"
cd docs
make html
open _build/html/index.html
```

#### Codecov set up

Once the newly generated repository has been pushed to github, there is one last thing to do: set up code coverage with **codecov**.
To do this, head over to [codecov][] and the "getting started" instructions on the [codecov setup docs][]. You can directly login with your github account to codecov.

In short, you need to:

1. Go to the _Settings_ of your newly created repository on github.
2. Go to _Security > Secrets > Actions_.
3. Create new repository secret with Name **CODECOV_TOKEN** and Value alphanumeric sequence.
4. Go back to Github Actions page an re-run previously failed jobs.

All CI checks should pass, you are ready to start developing your new tool!
