# Developer documentation

Welcome to the developer guidelines! This document is split into two parts:

-   A section about the repository setup. It describes how the build system and automated checks work
-   A contributor guide. It contains all information relevant to developers who want to make a contribution.

## Setting up the repository

### Documentation on _readthedocs_

We recommend using [readthedocs.org][] (RTD) to build and host the documentation for your project.
To enable readthedocs, head over to [their webiste][readthedocs.org] and sign in with your GitHub account.
On the RTD dashboard choose "Import a Project" and follow the instructions to add your repository.

-   Make sure to choose the correct name of the default branch. On GitHub, the default name of the default branch has
    recently changed from `master` to `main`.
-   We recommend to enable documentation builds for pull requests. This ensures that a PR doesn't introduce changes
    that break the documentation. To do so, got to `Admin -> Advanced Settings`, check the
    `Build pull requests for this projects` option, and click `Save`. For more information, please refer to
    the [official RTD documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html).

### Coverage tests with _Codecov_

Coverage tells you what fraction of your code is "covered" by unit tests.
To enable coverage checks, head over to [codecov][] and sign in with your GitHub account.
You'll find more information in "getting started" section of the [codecov docs][].
You can directly login with your GitHub account to Codecov.

In brief, you need to:

1. Generate a Codecov Token by clicking _setup repo_ in the codecov dashboard.
2. Go to the _Settings_ of your newly created repository on GitHub.
3. Go to _Security > Secrets > Actions_.
4. Create new repository secret with name `CODECOV_TOKEN` and paste the token generated by codecov
5. Go back to Github Actions page an re-run previously failed jobs.

### Pre-commit checks

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) checks are fast programs that
check code for errors, inconsistencies and code styles, before the code
is committed.

We recommend setting up [pre-commit.ci][] to enforce consistency checks on every commit
and pull-request.

To do so, head over to [pre-commit.ci][] and click "Sign In With GitHub". Follow
the instructions to enable pre-commit.ci for your account or your organization. You
may choose to enable the service for an entire organization or on a per-repository basis.

Once authorized, pre-commit.ci should automatically be activated.

#### Overview of pre-commit hooks used by the template

The following pre-commit checks for code style and format.

-   [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): standard code
    formatter in Python.
-   [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): sort module imports into
    sections and types.
-   [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html): standard code
    formatter for non-Python files (e.g. YAML).
-   [blacken-docs](https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs): black on
    python code in docs.

The following pre-commit checks for errors, inconsistencies and typing.

-   [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): standard check for errors in Python files.
    -   [flake8-tidy-imports](https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-tidy-imports):
        tidy module imports.
    -   [flake8-docstrings](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-docstrings):
        pydocstyle extension of flake8.
    -   [flake8-rst-docstrings](https://github.com/peterjc/e8-rst-docstrings):
        extension of `flake8-docstrings` for `rst` docs.
    -   [flake8-comprehensions](https://github.com/adamchainz/e8-comprehensions):
        write better list/set/dict comprehensions.
    -   [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear):
        find possible bugs and design issues in program.
    -   [flake8-blind-except](https://github.com/elijahandrews/flake8-blind-except):
        checks for blind, catch-all `except` statements.
-   [yesqa](https://github.com/asottile/yesqa):
    remove unneccesary `# noqa` comments, follows additional dependencies listed above.
-   [autoflake](https://github.com/PyCQA/autoflake):
    remove unused imports and variables.
-   [pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks): generic pre-commit hooks.
    -   **detect-private-key**: checks for the existence of private keys.
    -   **check-ast**: check whether files parse as valid python.
    -   **end-of-file-fixer**:check files end in a newline and only a newline.
    -   **mixed-line-ending**: checks mixed line ending.
    -   **trailing-whitespace**: trims trailing whitespace.
    -   **check-case-conflict**: check files that would conflict with case-insensitive file systems.
-   [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade):
    upgrade syntax for newer versions of the language.

#### Notes on pre-commit checks

-   **flake8**: to ignore errors, you can add a comment `# noqa` to the offending line.
    You can also specify the error id to ignore with e.g. `# noqa: E731`.
    Check [flake8 guide](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/3.1.1/user/ignoring-errors.html) for reference.
-   You can add or remove pre-commit checks by simply deleting relevant lines in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
    Some pre-commit checks have additional options that can be specified either in the `pyproject.toml` or pre-commit
    specific config files, such as `.prettierrc.yml` for **prettier** and `.flake8` for **flake8**.

### Tutorials with nbsphinx and jupyter notebooks

The documentation is set-up to render jupyter notebooks stored in the `docs/notebooks` directory using [nbsphinx][].
Currently, only fully executed notebooks in `.ipynb` format are supported. It is your reponsibility to update
and re-run the notebook whenever necessary.

If you are interested in automatically running notebooks as part of the continuous integration, please check
out [this feature request](https://github.com/scverse/cookiecutter-scverse/issues/40) in the `cookiecutter-scverse`
repository.

### Ignore certain lint warnings

The [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) include [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) which checks
for errors in Python files, including stylistic errors.

In some cases it might overshoot and you may have good reasons to ignore certain warnings. To do so, edit the `.flake8`
file in the root of the repository. Add one line per linting code you wish to ignore and don't forget to add a comment.

```toml
...
# line break before a binary operator -> black does not adhere to PEP8
W503
# line break occured after a binary operator -> black does not adhere to PEP8
W504
...
```

### Using VCS-based versioning

### Template sync with _cookietemple_

TODO

<!--
 We use cookietemple to keep your package in sync with the template. A bot will make a pull request to your repository if we update the template. Like that you may benefit from new features or if we fix the build system. -->

## Contributing guide

Scanpy provides extensive [developer documentation][scanpy developer guide], most of which applies to this repo, too.
This document will not reproduce the entire content from there. Instead, it aims at summarizing the most important
information to get you started on contributing.

TODO

-   tutorials

    -   This repository is currently set-up for including jupyter notebooks in ipynb format _including outputs_.
        We are thinking about adding CI builds for tutorials in the future, but this can be challenging depending on the resource requiresments to build the tutorials. See the discussion at <> if you are interested in this feature.


Take inspirations from the scanpy, scvi and muon developer guides!

TODO: write developer guide first, then docs of the template!
