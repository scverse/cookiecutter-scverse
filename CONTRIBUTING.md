## Making a release

To release a new version of the template, create a new release
on the [github release page](https://github.com/scverse/cookiecutter-scverse/releases).
Choose a tag name of the format `vX.X.X` that adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Note that when creating a new release, changes will be propagated to packages using this template.
Therefore, use good measure when to create a release in order not to flood ecosystem packages with
requests.
