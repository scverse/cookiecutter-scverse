# Set-up online services

**Your repository is now ready.
However, to use all features of the template you will need to set up the following online services.**
Clicking on the links will take you to the respective sections of the developer documentation.
The developer documentation is also shipped as part of the template in docs/developer_docs.md.

1.  [pre-commit.ci][setup-pre-commit] to check for inconsistencies and to enforce a code style
2.  [readthedocs.org][setup-rtd] to build and host documentation
3.  [codecov][setup-codecov] to generate test coverage reports

All CI checks should pass, you are ready to start developing your new tool!

# Install the package

To run tests or build the documentation locally, you need to install your package and its dependencies.
You can do so with

```bash
pip install ".[test,dev,doc]"
```

# Customizations

Further instructions on using this template can be found in the [dev docs included in the project][dev-docs].

# Commitment

We expect developers of scverse ecosystem packages to

-   [write unit tests][write-tests]
-   [provide documentation][write-docs], including tutorials where applicable
-   support users through github and the [scverse discourse][]
